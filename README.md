StarJewledBot
=============

Blizzard made an exclusive Portrait in Starcraft that you can only get by beating Starjeweled in a difficult manner. This bot beats the game perfectly so you can get that portrait.

* Turn our system sound all the way down (but don't mute it).
* Run the application in XCode.
* Run Starcraft in Fullscreen (Windowed) mode.
* Put the mouse in the exact upper left corner pixel of the Bewjeweled screen.
* Increase your system volume. The louder your volume the faster the bot will play.
